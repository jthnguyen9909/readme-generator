## Description

This is a text editor that runs in the browser that meets the PWA criteria. It features data persistence that operate in the case that other methods are not supported by the browser and will also function offline. In addition to running in the browser, the application can also be installed on devices and run independently.

## Usage

The application is quite straightforward, in once a user visits the application's url, they will be greeted with the text editor, and with an example in the text field. The user can then input any text they'd like and the data will persist whether they leave the page, disconnect, refresh, or anything of the sort through the use of IndexedDB. The user is also able to use the text editor offline as well, as the all the applications features will also work offline. In the top left of the page or in the browser's address bar, there will be buttons that will then prompt the user if they'd like to install the application directly instead of running it in the browser, and the application is able to run independently as its own program with all the features intact.
