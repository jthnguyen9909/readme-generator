## Usage

The user will first be navigated to the landing html page which will then redirect them to the main notes page. Any stored notes will be rendered on the left column when the page loads. The user can then create a new note by typing in a note's title, as well as a description of any length within the text boxes rendered. When the user is done, they can then click on the save icon that will only appear if the title and text sections are filled out, and then the note will appear on the left side column with any previous notes. Any notes that are saved can also be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon. Any saved note's description can also be reviewed by clicking on the title of the saved note. If the user wants to create a new note after reviewing an old note, they can click on the plus icon to recreate an empty input form.
